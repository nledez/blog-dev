I'm going to attempt to live blog and take notes about the talks at the <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/">Professional Ruby Conference</a> today and tomorrow. Stay tuned! :) (By the way, huge thanks to <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/11/10/and-the-winner-is/">Antonio Cangiano</a>)

I'll keep this post updated with links to the other conference notes posts as the day goes on.

The slides are going to be posted <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/presentations/">here</a>. I'll link the slides to my notes once the conference is over.
