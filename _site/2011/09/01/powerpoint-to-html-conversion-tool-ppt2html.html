As part of my mission to Yellow Pages, I developed a tool to converts PowerPoint file into html pages. The tool was written in Ruby. I've got permission to put it into open source so you can also convert your slides to just simply share.

An example of what happens:
<a href="http://hosting-service.pagesjaunes.fr/" title="Pages Jaunes hosting services">Pages Jaunes hostting services</a>

Sources of the tool:

<a href="https://github.com/nledez/ppt2html-assets" title="Assets Sources">Assets sources if you not like the default</a>
